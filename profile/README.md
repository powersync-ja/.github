# PowerSync: Postgres<>SQLite sync layer for your existing backend
PowerSync keeps backend SQL databases in sync with on-device SQLite databases embedded in a client SDK. It enables real-time reactive offline-first/local-first apps that remain available even when network connectivity is poor or non-existent. 

Offline-first / local-first is a paradigm where your app code works directly with a client-side embedded database, which automatically syncs with a backend database in the background.

PowerSync currently supports Postgres with [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync), [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/powersync-sdk-react-native) and [web](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-web-sdk). Additional backend database support and SDKs are [on the way](https://roadmap.powersync.com/).

## Repos
We plan on releasing an open-source version of the [PowerSync service](https://docs.powersync.com/architecture/powersync-service). Supporting self-hosting is one of the steps to get there. 

### Client SDKs
Client SDKs are open-source, available under the Apache 2.0 license:
- [Flutter/Dart SDK](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart)
- [React Native SDK](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-react-native-sdk)
- [Web/JS](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-web-sdk)

### Standalone libraries
Open-source, MIT license:
- [sqlite_async](https://github.com/powersync-ja/sqlite_async.dart) â€” asynchronous interface for SQLite on Dart & Flutter (used by PowerSync Flutter/Dart SDK)

### Examples and demo apps
See here: [Demo Apps / Examples](https://docs.powersync.com/resources/demo-apps-examples)

Demo apps are listed under the backend they use, but you can easily wire up your own backend as documented [here](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/installation/app-backend-setup).

We're constantly expanding our list of example implementations. If you'd like to see an example currently not available, [let us know on Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync). 

## Team
PowerSync was spun off from [JourneyApps](https://github.com/journeyapps-platform), a product that's been in production for over 10 years. PowerSync was founded by [@cahofmeyr](https://github.com/cahofmeyr) and [@rkistner](https://github.com/rkistner) and built by the JourneyApps engineering team.
